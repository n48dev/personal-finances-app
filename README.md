# Anthony's Personal Finance App

This is a simple web application designed to help manage **personal finances**. The app currently provides functionality for tracking expenses and calculating credit card installment payments.

## Main features

- ðŸ“Š **Expense management**: Displays a table with total expenses, including subscriptions, and converts amounts into Colombian Pesos (COP) based on the conversion rates set in `sampleData.js`.
- ðŸ§® **Installment and interest calculator**: Allows users to calculate the total cost of a credit card purchase, showing the monthly interest, total interest paid, installment amount, and final payment. Users can input the purchase amount, number of installments, and optionally, an effective annual interest rate (E.A.). If no rate is provided, a default rate is used as indicated in the input placeholder.

## Technologies used

This app is built using the following technologies:

- **HTML5**: For the structure of the page.
- **CSS3**: For design and style, including adaptability to different devices through responsive design techniques.
- **JavaScript**: For polyfills and functionalities.
